Automated Testing in C# with MVC, TDD, and Design Patterns.

Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of automated tests in C#, focusing on best practices such as Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and the use of Design Patterns to create scalable and maintainable software solutions.
Features

    MVC Architecture: The project follows the MVC design pattern to separate concerns, making it easier to maintain and test individual components (Model, View, Controller).

    Test-Driven Development (TDD): Tests are written before the actual implementation to ensure that code is reliable and meets the required functionality from the start.

    Design Patterns: Several common design patterns, such as Repository, Factory, and Singleton, are applied to demonstrate how to structure the code effectively and facilitate testing.

    Automated Unit Tests: The project uses automated unit tests with frameworks like NUnit or XUnit to validate code behavior.

Technologies

    C#
    ASP.NET Core MVC
    NUnit/XUnit (for unit testing)
    Moq (for mocking dependencies in tests)
    Design Patterns: Repository, Singleton, Factory, etc.
